        <li>
          <h3>What should I wear? Is there a dress code?</h3>
          <p>
            We would love for our guests to dress in semi-formal attire. Whether
            you choose to arrive in your finest robes, elven cloaks, or elegant
            Muggle wear, we simply ask that you come dressed to celebrate!
          </p>

          <h3>Can I expect dancing, merriment, and revelry?</h3>
          <p>
            Without a doubt! The night shall be filled with music, dancing, and
            joyous celebrations. Whether you waltz like an elegant elf or throw
            it down like a Hufflepuff after a Butterbeer, all are welcome on the
            dance floor!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Are pets allowed?</h3>
          <p>
            As much as we adore our furry companions, we ask that they remain in
            the Shire for this journey (unless otherwise noted for service
            animals). However, our own beloved beasts of the realm (our dogs)
            will be honoured and present.
          </p>

        <li>
          <h3>Where should I stay? Do you have hotel recommendations?</h3>

            We have reserved rooms at [Hotel Name] for our traveling guests. You
            can book using [Reservation Code or Link]. Additional accommodations
            can be found nearby in [City/Area Name].

        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Can I bring a plus one?</h3>
          <p>
            Your invitation will specify if you have a plus one included. If you
            have questions, feel free to reach out, and we will do our best to
            accommodate!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Are you doing a registry or gifts?</h3>
          <p>
            Your presence is the greatest gift of all! However, if you feel
            inclined, we have a registry at [Registry Link], or contributions to
            our [honeymoon fund / home fund / charity] would be deeply
            appreciated.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Can I take photos?</h3>
          <p>
            We would love for you to enjoy the moment with us! During the
            ceremony, we kindly ask for an unplugged experience—but once the
            reception begins, snap away!

        <li>
          <h3>Any other magical surprises we should prepare for?</h3>

            laughter, and a few enchanting surprises along the way.
