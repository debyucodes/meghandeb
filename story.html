          <h4>Saturday, August 15, 2020–<br />The Rest of our lives</h4>
          <h4>Issue #1</h4>
        </div>
        <p class="big-letter">
          In the year of our reckoning, amidst the long shadow of the Great
          Plague (known in lesser tongues as COVID-19), two souls set forth on a
          most unexpected adventure.
        </p>

        <div>
          <p class="big-letter">
            Separated by lands yet connected by the magic of the ether (or, as
            the wise call it, FaceTime), Meg and Deb first beheld each other’s
            countenances through the shimmering light of a screen. Their first
            nights were spent in merriment, watching grand performances of
            dazzling queens in a virtual Drag Concert Hall, their laughter
            echoing through the unseen threads of fate.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>I did my waiting! Four months of it!</h3>
          <p class="big-letter">
            But the time came when mere visions and echoes would no longer
            suffice. With great courage (and six feet of distance), they
            embarked upon their first quest into the wilds—an encounter where no
            hands were clasped, yet hearts drew near. They traversed the perils
            of masked greetings and frostbitten outdoor walks, forging a bond
            stronger than mithril. Through victories and trials, their
            fellowship grew—two became one, and with them, their noble
            companions of fur and paw joined in harmonious kinship.

          <h3>
            Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only
            remembers to turn on the light
          </h3>
          <p class="big-letter">
            But no great tale is without sorrow. In the darkness, they faced
            sickness, loss, and the aching weight of farewells. Yet, even in the
            deepest night, they found light in one another—offering solace,
            love, and a steadfast promise to walk together, come what may.
          </p>
          <p class="big-letter">
            Now, as they stand upon the threshold of a new chapter, a great
            feast is called, and banners are raised! Friends, kin, and kindred
            spirits shall gather to witness the forging of a new alliance, a
            bond sealed in love and laughter.

          <h3>The Proposal</h3>
          <p>
            Through the Highlands fair, they journey forth,<br />
            Where Glen Coe’s peaks did rise,<br />
            By Hagrid’s hut and shimmering pond,<br />
            ‘Neath the ever-changing sky.
          </p>

          <p>
            Deb led Meg down a tricky path,<br />
            Near slips, but no tumble came,<br />
            As the rain began to pour, <br />
            A picture snapped, Deb tongue tied.<br />
          </p>

          <p>
            Then down on one knee,<br />
            Deb asked with tears in her eye,<br />
            “Meghan Corry,<br />
            Will you marry me?”<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            The moment stretched like enchanted mist,<br />
            Time seemed to hold its breath,<br />
            “Baby, it’s on the ground,” she said<br />
            For the ring had slipped and tumbled down.
