      <p class="big-letter">In a sleepy village in the Cornell, a young hobbit is entrusted with an immense task. She must take a perilous journey across the GTA to Newmarket. The only thing that prevents it was the Dark Lord Saurons evil dominion: The Global Pandemic.</p>

        <p class="big-letter">Meg and Deb first met in February 2020, they had made plans for coffee date when Deb returns home from NYC. But the dark lord had different plans for them.</p>

        <h3>Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light</h3>
        <p class="big-letter">Due to the global pandemic and lockdown, their plans to meet in person went into the lava of Mount Doom. On April 8, 2020, they went on their first ever date virtually. Of course, it was a virtual drag show with their fave Rupaul Drag Race queens.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>I did my waiting! Twleve years of it!</h3>
        <p class="big-letter">After a month of virtual dates and daily meme sharing, they decided to go for a walk in Fairy Park near Meg's residence, staying six feet apart, of course. On August 15, 2020, Deb asked Meg to be her girlfriend after dinner at the Flying Monkey Brewery. </p>
          <p class="big-letter">Later that evening, they drove home from Barrie with just 1% gas left. Deb was stressed, but Meg's calm demeanor, as always, helped ease her worries. In that moment, Deb knew Meg was the one. And the rest? Well, that's none of your business.</p>

        <h3>The Proposal</h3>
        <p>Through the Highlands fair, they journey forth,<br>
Where Glen Coe’s peaks did rise,<br>
By Hagrid’s hut and shimmering pond,<br>
‘Neath the ever-changing sky.</p>

<p>Deb led Meg down a tricky path,<br>
  Near slips, but no tumble came,<br>
  As the rain began to pour, <br>
  A picture snapped, Deb tongue tied.<br>
<p>
  Then down on one knee,<br>
Deb asked with tears in her eye,<br>
“Meghan Corry,<br>
Will you marry me?”<br>
</p>
<p>
  The moment stretched like enchanted mist,<br>
  Time seemed to hold its breath,<br>
  “Baby, it’s on the ground,” she said<br>
  For the ring had slipped and tumbled down.
